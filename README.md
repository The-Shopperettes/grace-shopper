# Wild Roots
Wild Roots is an ecommerce plant site that was developed for the Grace Shopper Senior Phase project in the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy.

## Overview
Wild Roots was designed to offer customers an easy-to-use site to browse a vast collection of plants from the comfort of their home. Customers are able to shop as a guest or as a logged in user. Similar to other ecommerce sites, users have the ability to add various items and quantities of items to their cart, as well as adjust or remove items once they are on the cart page. Furthermore, users can complete their order by checkout out via Stripe.

Wild Roots also offers select capabilities for users with administrative permissions. These administrators also have the ability to add, edit, and delete products and manage users of the site. 

Wild Roots maintains security for each user. Access to an individual user's cart and profile can only be obtained by accessing the specific user's token, therefore verifying that it is truly them. Furthermore, extra requirements must be met in order for administrative capabilities to be rendered onto the page.
